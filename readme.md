## Benchmark Problem - Shock tube
The numerical methods implemented in the source code are investigated for the benchmark problem of the shock tube in one dimension. The reason for a simple implementation is such to provide further understanding of the numerical methods themselves rather than focusing on a more complex problem. More details on the problem description as well as some useful tools can be found at [NASA webpage](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/stube/stube.html).
