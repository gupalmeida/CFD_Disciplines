## CC-297 - Fundamentals of Computational Fluid Mechanics
This discipline offers the opportunity to work on some very challenging problems. The students have the chance to implement numerical algorithms for solving a simple flow over an airfoil, as well as implement code for generating differential equation based grid generators.

## CC-298 - Numerical Methods in Fluid Mechanics
At this moment the students are familiar with the basic techniques for solving differential equations numerically and the discipline offers the chance for pursuing knowledge on different numerical schemes for fluid mechanics problems. The main focus is to give a background on what is behind commercial CFD solvers like flux splitting schemes, upwind schemes, and so on.

## CC-299 - High Order Numerical Methods
All the projects related to this discipline challenges for solving the benchmark problem of a 1-D shock tube using high order and high resolution methods.
### Benchmark Problem - 1-D Shock tube
The high order and high resolution numerical methods implemented in the source code are investigated for the benchmark problem of the shock tube in one dimension. The reason for a simple implementation is such to provide further understanding of the numerical methods themselves rather than focusing on a more complex problem. More details on the problem description as well as some useful tools can be found at [NASA webpage](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/stube/stube.html).
